# 🎯 TONIGHT_FOCUS — Nightly PM Prioritization

**Date:** 2026-02-19  
**Session:** Nightly Feature Development v2  
**Selected Feature:** Memory Activity Feed for Mission Control

---

## Selected: Memory Activity Feed Widget

### What It Is
A live-updating widget on the Mission Control dashboard that displays the 10 most recent memory files from `/home/toilet/clawd/memory/`, with preview snippets and quick-open actions. Uses the existing `/api/files` and `/api/file/[path]` endpoints with 5-second polling.

### Why This One

**Impact Rationale:**
- Users (Vap3) write memory files daily but have no visibility into recent entries without browsing the filesystem
- Closes the loop on the 2nd Brain's "live filesystem integration" — currently the dashboard shows tasks, but not the thoughts/memories behind them
- Enables quick pattern recognition: "What was I thinking about last week?"

**Marketing Angle:**
- Demo-friendly visual feature that shows the 2nd Brain is "alive" with your data
- Highlights the unique live filesystem sync capability (not just another notes app)
- Great screenshot for README/GitHub: "Your thoughts, automatically surfaced"

**Estimated Scope:** Small (~2-3 hours)
- API endpoints already exist and tested
- UI pattern established (Mission Control cards)
- No new dependencies needed
- Reuses existing glassmorphism components

## Technical Notes

**Files to Modify:**
- `app/mission-control/page.tsx` — Add Memory Activity card/widget
- May need: `app/api/memory-activity/route.ts` — Wrapper that returns last 10 .md files with snippets

**API Status (from 2026-02-15 debug session):**
- `/api/files` — Working, returns all files (may need filtering for `.md` only)
- `/api/file/[path]` — Working, returns file content
- Dev server: `npm run dev` on port 3000

**Existing Components to Reuse:**
- `Card`, `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardContent` — Glass card styling
- `Badge` — For date tags
- `Skeleton` — Loading states
- `EmptyState` — No memories found

## Context from Memory

From `2026-02-15.md` — Claude Code debug session confirmed:
> "The core functionality is working — the API serves files and the dashboard should show them."

From `2026-02-16.md` — Mission Control Center shipped:
> "Vap3's verdict: 'looks good i like it!'"

The infrastructure is solid. This feature is a natural extension.

## Success Criteria

1. Widget displays 10 most recent `.md` files from `/home/toilet/clawd/memory/`
2. Shows filename, modified date, and first 100 chars preview
3. Click to open full file (reuse document viewer or new tab)
4. Auto-refresh every 5 seconds
5. Empty state when no memory files
6. Responsive design (fits in Mission Control grid)

## Marketing Copy (Draft)

> **"Your second brain remembers what you forgot."**
> 
> The Memory Activity feed automatically surfaces your recent thoughts, notes, and daily logs — no digging through folders required.
