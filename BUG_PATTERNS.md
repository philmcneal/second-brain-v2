# 🐛 BUG_PATTERNS.md — Recurring Issues & Prevention Notes

This file tracks patterns spotted across nightly bug hunts. Each entry includes the root cause, prevention strategy, and whether a linter/test rule was added.

## Pattern 1: New API routes ship without tests

**First spotted:** 2026-02-19 (nightly bug hunt v2)  
**Affected files:** `app/api/config-analysis/route.ts`, `app/api/config-files/[filename]/route.ts` (both added in nightly/2026-02-18 with 0 test coverage)

**Root cause:** Feature pressure — routes land in the same commit as UI components and there's no enforced test-coverage gate.

**Prevention:**
- When adding a new `route.ts`, create `__tests__/<name>.test.ts` in the same commit
- PR checklist: "Does this route have at least a happy-path and an error-path test?"
- Consider adding `--coverage --coverage.thresholds.lines=80` to CI (vitest supports this)

**Status:** Fixed 2026-02-19 — 19 tests added covering both routes

## Pattern 2: Module-level mutable state in server routes

**First spotted:** 2026-02-19  
**Affected file:** `app/api/config-analysis/route.ts` — `let suggestionIdCounter = 0`

**Root cause:** Using a module-level counter for ID generation. In a long-running Node.js process this works but the IDs drift indefinitely. In serverless/edge environments the counter resets on cold starts, creating ID gaps. Not a functional bug today but a gotcha if IDs are ever persisted externally.

**Prevention:**
- Prefer `crypto.randomUUID()` or `Date.now() + Math.random()` for IDs that don't need sequential ordering
- If sequential order matters, use the DB/store as the source of truth, not a process-level counter

**Status:** Low severity — documented for future refactor
